# Pressure-Sensor-Matrix
The main objective of the project is to understand and study the concept of fabric based wearable sensors. This project implements a pressure measuring circuit using Arduino.
A Pressure Sensor MatrixÂ  is a device that simultaneously measures the pressure at each contact point between two touching surfaces. This results in a pressure profile map between the two surfaces. The circuit mainly consists of 4 different pressure points present in a 2 X 2 matrix (basically a square, as shown in figure below).The sensors are connected to a microprocessor. The amount of pressure exerted and the location of pressure exertion will be displayed in the monitor. 

# Prerequisites
1- Arduio IDE - Programs written using arduino are called sketches. Running and uploading the sketches on to the arduino board is done using Ardunio IDE.
Can be downloaded from the offical arduino website. 
Download Link : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2- Processing IDE - The Processing IDE is used to process the arduino codes. It can communicate with the Arduino IDE through serial communication. This way, we can send data from the Arduino to the Processing IDE and also from the Processing IDE to the Arduino.

# Installing
Download the source code from the respository and open the .ino file using Arduino IDE and .pde file using Processing IDE. Run the source code in arduino IDE. Open the serial monitor to check the result.
